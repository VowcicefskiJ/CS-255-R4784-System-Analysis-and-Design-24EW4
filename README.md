# CS-255-R4784-System-Analysis-and-Design-24EW4

**Overview**

This repository contains key documents that I have developed as part of the CS255 course, focusing on system analysis and design. The documents included are the Business Requirements Document from Project One and the System Design Document from Project Two. These artifacts demonstrate my skills in gathering requirements and designing systems that effectively meet client needs.

**Projects Summary
DriverPass Project**

**Client: DriverPass, a company offering driver training services to help students pass their DMV driving tests.**

System Objective: Develop a comprehensive system to provide online classes, practice tests, and on-the-road training, aimed at addressing high failure rates at the DMV.

**What I Did Well**

I excelled in designing a user-friendly system that integrates various functionalities seamlessly. My approach to creating detailed UML diagrams and interactive UI designs has been particularly effective in making the system easy to navigate and use.

**Area for Improvement**

If I were to revise one part of my work, it would be the integration of real-time data from DMV systems into our scheduling system. Enhancing this integration would streamline the booking process for driving tests, making it even more efficient.

**User Needs Implementation**

Understanding and implementing user needs were important in this project. I employed a user-centered design approach, evident from the Use Case and Activity Diagrams which outline the complete user interaction with the system. Considering user needs is crucial as it ensures the system is practical and addresses the real challenges users face.

**Design Approach**

My approach to software design focuses on modularity and scalability. I rely on UML diagrams to visualize system components and their interactions clearly. Going forward, I would enhance my techniques by incorporating more agile methodologies to accommodate changes more fluidly.

**Submission Details**

Please refer to the Business Requirements and System Design documents included in this repository. These documents are essential for understanding the depth and breadth of the system designed for DriverPass. There are also documents added that go with these 2 main documents that can be reviewed.
